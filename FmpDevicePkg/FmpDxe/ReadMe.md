# Firmware Management Protocol (FMP) DXE

## About

This driver produces an instance of the Firmware Management Protocol (`EFI_FIRMWARE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL`) that is used
to support updates to a firmware image stored on a firmware device. Platform-specific information and customization
is configured through libraries and PCDs.

---

## Getting Started

This driver integrates several customization points that need to be considered during firmware update. This section
provides brief background on key elements to consider when adapting this driver for a platform firmware.

### Capsule Authentication

The firmware update capsule must be signed and this driver will verify the integrity of the capsule contents. The
actual capsule data is preceded by an `EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_AUTHENTICATION` structure. This structure contains a
monotonic count and a `WIN_CERTIFICATE_UEFI_GUID` member that contains a signature that covers both the monotonic
count and the capsule payload data. These two elements ensure replay protection across update operations and
authentication. The certificate type used must be `EFI_CERT_TYPE_PKCS7_GUID`.

An EDK II implementation of signature verification is available in the following `FmpAuthenticationLib` instance:
[SecurityPkg/Library/FmpAuthenticationLibPkcs7](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/SecurityPkg/Library/FmpAuthenticationLibPkcs7).

### Capsule Versioning

The capsule version should only be allowed to increment in value across updates to prevent rollback attacks. The
`EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR` structure contains `Version` and `LowestSupportedImageVersion` fields that are used
to check for compliance during firmware update. `Version` must be greater than or equal to
`LowestSupportedImageVersion` in the current firmware and the greater than `Version` of the current firmware.

An EDK II library implementation (`EdkiiSystemCapsuleLib`) that performs version checking is available at:
[SignedCapsulePkg/Library/EdkiiSystemCapsuleLib](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/SignedCapsulePkg/Library/EdkiiSystemCapsuleLib).

### Device-Specific Functionality During Update

A capsule can target firmware update to a diverse set of devices on a system. Each device might bring unique logic
and requirements to the firmware update process. Therefore, a library class called `FmpDeviceLib` exists that allows
for instances written specific to a particular device.

For more information about `FmpDeviceLib`, review:
[FmpDevicePkg/Library/FmpDeviceLibNull/ReadMe.md](../Library/FmpDeviceLibNull/ReadMe.md)

### Dependency Considerations

The UEFI Specification 2.8 version introduced support for expressing dependencies between components involved in a
capsule update. For instance, FWx requires FWy to be at least version 2.0 to install. This information is primarily
conveyed to `FmpDxe` through the `FmpDependencyCheckLib` and `FmpDependencyLib` library classes.

More information about the overall infrastructure is available in:
[Section 23.2 of the UEFI Specification 2.8B](https://uefi.org/specifications)
[Tianocore wiki: Fmp Capsule Dependency Introduction](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Fmp-Capsule-Dependency-Introduction)

More details regarding the libraries in `FmpDevicePkg` are available in the respective ReadMe files:
[FmpDevicePkg/Library/FmpDependencyCheckLib][FmpDevicePkg/Library/FmpDependencyCheckLib/ReadMe.md](../Library/FmpDependencyCheckLib/ReadMe.md)
[FmpDevicePkg/Library/FmpDependencyLib][FmpDevicePkg/Library/FmpDependencyLib/ReadMe.md](../Library/FmpDependencyLib/ReadMe.md)

### Update Policy

A library class (`CapsuleUpdatePolicyLib`) is used to make platform-specific policy decisions available to the
firmware update process. This includes information such as whether the system power/thermal state permits firmware
to be updated. A few functions also exist to modify expected behavior such as ignoring the
`LowestSupportedImageVersion` check or not locking the firmware device for update when the FMP lock event is signaled.
It is important to note that the latter functions should only be used in very rare special cases such as during
manufacturing flows.

## Design Changes

- **Date:** 06/15/2020
- **Description/Rationale:** Extending on the more granular LastAttemptStatus support added in FmpDeviceSetImage (),
FmpDeviceCheckImage () also has a LastAttemptStatus parameter added. An image check is always performed by a set
image operation. A more granular status code from the check image path greatly improves overall error isolation when
applying an image.
- **Changes:** This change allows the FmpDeviceLib implementation to return a last attempt status code in the range
LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_LIBRARY_ERROR_MIN_ERROR_CODE to LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_LIBRARY_ERROR_MAX_ERROR_CODE. Furthermore,
an internal wrapper for CheckTheImage () in FmpDxe was added called CheckTheImageInternal (). This function can return
a last attempt status code for an error in the driver prior to invoking FmpDeviceCheckImage (). These driver error
codes will be in the range of LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_ERROR_UNSUCCESSFUL_VENDOR_RANGE_MIN to
LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_DRIVER_ERROR_MAX_ERROR_CODE.
- **Impact/Mitigation:**
The change break the build for all FmpDeviceLib instances due to the API change. Each FmpDeviceLib should change to
the new API definition and implement support to return unique values for LastAttemptStatus when appropriate.

- **Date:** 10/07/2019
- **Description/Rationale:** Capsule update is the process where each OEM has a lot of interest. Especially when there
is capsule update failure, it is helpful to gather more information of the failure. With existing implementations, the
SetImage routine from FmpDxe driver, which performs most heavy lifting during capsule update, will only
populate LastAttemptStatus with limited pre-defined error codes which could be consumed/inspected by the OS when it
recovers and boots. Thus our proposal is to update the SetImage routine and leverage the
LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_ERROR_UNSUCCESSFUL_VENDOR_RANGE range newly defined in UEFI Spec 2.8 Section 23.4, so that the
error code will provide better granularity when viewing capsule update failure from OS device manager.
- **Changes:** A few error codes (128 total) are reserved from LAST_ATTEMPT_STATUS_ERROR_UNSUCCESSFUL_VENDOR_RANGE
range for FmpDxe driver usage, which ranges from thermal and power API failure to capsule payload header check failure.
Furthermore, *an output pointer of the LastAttemptStatus is added as an input argument for FmpDeviceSetImage function
in FmpDeviceLib to allow platform to provide their own platform specific error codes*.
(SPI write failure, SVN checking failure, and more).
- **Impact/Mitigation:**
The italic text above will cause a breaking change for all the FmpDeviceLib instances due to API being modified. This
is to provide better visibility to OEMs to decode capsule update failures more efficiently. Each FmpDeviceLib should
change to the new API definition and populate proper LastAttemptStatus values when applicable.
